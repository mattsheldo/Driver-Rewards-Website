AJAX commands are important for communicating to the backend. Download
JQuery for this:
  1) Download JQuery to the server
  2) Copy it to the website root directory
  3) Include it in any html files that need to use it like so:
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>

For JavaScript, try to always offload the code into its own JS file. Also, try
not to use "var" when declaring a variable because it has a weird scoping. You
should always be able to use "let" or "const". Generally an init() function is
required to initially load the page.
