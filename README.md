# Truck Driver Rewards
by Zach Amend, Devon Gilliard, and Matt Sheldon

## Introduction
This is the source code for our Driver Rewards website. The 3 of us worked in an agile development setting across 10 week long sprints. We started the first sprint off with creating just over 200 user stories that we would work to accomplish throughout the 10 sprints. We had a meeting every week to show our progress to eachother and a class TA who acted similar to a SCRUM leader. The purpose of the website is to  create a place where companies can reward drivers good driving habits with the ability to buy products from a company catalog. 

## User Types
We had 3 different types of users on our websites drivers, sponsors, and admins. Each user had acess to different priviledges and features. Driver users had the least privileges then the sponsors and admins had full privileges.

### View as Another User
